# Comparing-Sorting-Algorithms
This file contains many different sorting algorithms and compares their time complexities in sorting different sizes of data. # * The user can enter the size of data being sorted and the program produces the amount of time taken to achieve that. # ? The objective of this program was to simply gain more experience with algorithm design and practice using more Python features such as working with date and time.  # TODO: Add a visualizer to show the list being sorted, let the user select which algorithm they wish to see, and rewrite code using Object Oriented Programming principles. # TODO: Add Radix Sort, Cocktail Sort, Gnome Sort, Heap Sort, Bitonic Sort, and Bucket Sort. # This file will continue to be updated on Github. Current sorting algorithms: Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Shell Sort, and Quick Sort.
